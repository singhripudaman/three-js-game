## Controls

WASD for movement. Mouse is only required to press Play.

## Topics Implemented

- Complex Movement Algorithms - Path Following
- Pathfinding - Flow Field Pathfinding
- Decision Making - State Machine
- Procedural Content Generation - Depth-First Backtracking Maze Generation
- Extra topics - Pursue and Evade

## Topic Locations

- `js\Game\Behaviour\Player.js`, `js\Game\Behaviour\NPC.js`, and `js\Game\Behaviour\State.js` contain the State Machine logic
- `js\Game\World\MazeGenerator.js` contains the code to generate the maze (Depth-First Backtracking Maze Generation)
- `js\Game\Behaviour\NPC.js` contains the Path Following and Flow Field Pathfinding
- `js\Game\World\GameMap.js` path finding

## Contribution

Ripudaman Singh:

- implement the wander movement algorithm.
- implement the state machine.
